# machine_learning_project

Developed a web-based intelligent system to predict the likelihood of dyslexia in individuals using behavioral task data. This system uses interaction-based metrics such as clicks, hits, misses, accuracy, and scores collected from desktop and tablet devices. The project aims to support early screening for learning difficulties by analyzing user performance across multiple cognitive tasks.

Key Features:

Built with Python, Scikit-learn, and Streamlit for an interactive user interface

Trained multiple machine learning models (Random Forest, SVM, Logistic Regression) and deployed the best performer

Handled data preprocessing, null value treatment, feature selection, and model evaluation

Implemented a clean and responsive UI with real-time prediction capabilities

Designed with user-friendly inputs like dropdowns, radio buttons, and visual feedback based on model output
